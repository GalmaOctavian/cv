  <h3>Work</h3>
  <p>
    When it comes to work i can say that i am happy and i love what i am doing.
    <br>
    <br>
    <em><strong>Head of digital</strong></em>
    <br>
    In my opinion <em>Head of Digital</em> is a very delicate job, most of the work that i am doing
    is based around branding. Now we are working on a big rebranding strategy. Primarily we want to unite all our little divided brands in one big powerfull brand.
    Also for marketing purposes is something that will boost our image both in digital world and the real world.
    <br>
    <br>
    <em><strong>Sales Agent</strong></em>
    <br>
    <em>Head of Digital</em> and <em>Sales Agent</em> are both two jobs that are working togheter.
    We are searching for companies that wants to do distribution for our products, and this is a very key moment for boosting our image.
    People are more atracted to buy online when they know that specific brand that they saw in a market someday
